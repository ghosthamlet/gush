* What's Gush?

Gush is inspired by [[http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/push.html][PushGP / Push]].  It's a stack based language,
similar to Push or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_%28programming_language%29][Forth]], and will eventually be usable for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming][genetic programming]].
The primary distinction between Gush and Push is how it avoids
type errors: Push uses one value stack per type and a broad number of
operators to operate on those individual types, while Gush uses a
single value stack and has a smaller number of operators using
generic methods which "search" the stack to see what values they
can operate on.  (This can be kept in check as Gush's programs can
be "limited" to a certain number of operations, and searching the
stack by missing an item counts against the limit, incentivizing
keeping relevant types near the type during operations.)

Gush also aims to implement a type of "memory", so that processes
can remember some details about their prior runs, and eventually,
might even teach their children based off of their own memories.
